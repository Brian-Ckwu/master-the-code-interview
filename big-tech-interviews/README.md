# Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews
One of the course of Master the Coding Interview.

## Course Outline

## Course Notes

### Steps
1. Verify the constraints
2. Write out some test cases (help capture the edge cases)
3. Figure out a solution without code (logically and critically)
    1. Working solution (not necessarily optimal)
    2. Optimal solution
4. Write out our solution in code (by hand)
5. Double check for errors
6. Test our code with our test cases
    1. Walk through the code by hand
7. Analyzing time and space complexity
8. Can we optimize the solution?
    - Hint: if the time and space complexity differ a lot, it a sign that we can sacrifice one to improve the other (e.g. using certain data structures to consume space to improve time)
